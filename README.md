## Project on Endomondo data

The project's aim is to parse XML data, generated by Endomondo app, save the parsed data and analyze it.
The data is collected by me, using Endomondo app at the period of **2016 05 - 2019 10**.

Data was manually extracted from Endomondo website for each workout as .tcx file and was put under Raw Data folder.
The parsing code was written to grab data from this folder, parse necessary fields and write them to .csv files.
Two .csv files were created: summary_data.csv and tracking_data.csv.

File summary_data.csv consists of summary information of each workout - one row per workout.
File tracking_data.csv consists of more detailed workout information and is mapped to summary_data.csv via ActivityID field

The data fields in summary_data.csv file:
- ActivityID
- FileName
- SportType
- StartDate
- StartTime
- TotalTime
- TotalDistance
- TotalCalories

The data fields in tracking_data.csv file:
- ActivityID
- TrackingID
- TrackingTime
- TrackingLatitude
- TrackingLongitude
- TrackingDistance
