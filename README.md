## Project on Endomondo data ##

The project aim is to parse XML data generated by Endomondo app, save the parsed data and analyze it
The data is collected by me using Endomondo app at the period of ** 2016 05 - 2018 12 **

Data was manually extracted from Endomondo website for each workout as .TCX file and put under Raw Data folder
The parsing code was written to grab data from this folder, parse necessary fields and write them to .CSV files
Two .CSV files were created: summary_data.csv and tracking_data.csv

File summary_data.csv consists of summary information of each workout - one row per workout
File tracking_data.csv consists of more detailed workout information and is mapped to summary_data.csv via ActivityID field

The data fields in summary_data.csv file:
- ActivityID
- FileName
- SportType
- StartDate
- StartTime
- TotalTime
- TotalDistance
- TotalCalories

The data fields in tracking_data.csv file:
- ActivityID
- TrackingID
- TrackingTime
- TrackingLatitude
- TrackingLongitude
- TrackingDistance
