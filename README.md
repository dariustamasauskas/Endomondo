## Project on Endomondo data

The project's aim is to parse XML data, generated by Endomondo app, save the parsed data and analyze it. The data is collected by me, using Endomondo app at the period of **2016 05 - 2019 10**.

Data was manually extracted from Endomondo website for each workout as .tcx file and was put under data/raw/ folder. The parsing code was written to grab data from this folder, parse necessary fields and write them to .csv files on data/parsed/ folder. The following .csv files were created:
- summary_data.csv
- tracking_data.csv

File summary_data.csv consists of summary information of each workout - one row per workout. The data fields in summary_data.csv file are the following:
- ActivityID
- FileName
- SportType
- StartDate
- StartTime
- TotalTime
- TotalDistance
- TotalCalories

File tracking_data.csv consists of more detailed workout information and is mapped to summary_data.csv via ActivityID field. The data fields in tracking_data.csv file are the following:
- ActivityID
- TrackingID
- TrackingTime
- TrackingLatitude
- TrackingLongitude
- TrackingDistance

Later on, summary_data.csv and tracking_data.csv files were loaded into Google BigQuery and analyzed further by writing SQL queries. The analysis could be found in the following file:
- analysis.md
